# python-newsfeed

[deployed heroku app](https://python-fake-news-api.herokuapp.com/login)

Another iteration of the Tech News API app using Python and Flask to set up the back-end server and sql alchemy as the ORM for querying the mySQL database.
The front-end used Jinja as the templating engine for dynamically rendering data.

The database of movies was sourced from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/dataset-netflix-shows). The csv file was read using pandas and inserted into the database using SQLAlcehmy.
